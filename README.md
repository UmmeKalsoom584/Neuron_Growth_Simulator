# **Neuron_Growth_Simulator 🧠**
An interactive Python simulator that creates realistic neuron shapes using mathematical random walks. Watch how simple rules can generate complex biological structures!

**🌟What It Does**
This simulator grows digital neurons using three simple rules:

1: Branch (split into two)
2: Grow (extend forward)
3: Stop (end growth)

**Control the growth with interactive sliders:**
β (Branching): How often branches split
α (Annihilation): How often growth stops

**Bias:** Growth direction 
**Initial Walkers:** Starting branches


**🎯 Examples**
Different neuron types:
**Complex neurons:** High branching (β=0.06), low annihilation (α=0.005)
**Simple neurons:** Low branching (β=0.01), high annihilation (α=0.03)
**Directional growth:** High bias for guided development

**🔬 Science Behind It**
Based on computational neuroscience research, this shows how simple mathematical rules (branching-and-annihilating random walks) can create realistic neuronal morphologies. Perfect for learning about brain modeling and biological simulations.
